    "We have seen several examples of assessing models that involve chance, by comparing observed data to the predictions made by the models. In all of our examples, there has been no doubt about whether the data were consistent with the model's predictions. The data were either very far away from the predictions, or very close to them.\n",

    "But outcomes are not always so clear cut. How far is \"far\"? Exactly what does \"close\" mean? While these questions don't have universal answers, there are guidelines and conventions that you can follow. In this section we will describe some of them.\n",

Using statistical tests as a way of making decisions is standard in many fields and has a standard terminology. Here is the sequence of the steps in most statistical tests, along with some terminology and examples. You will see that they are consistent with the sequence of steps we have used for assessing models."

    "**The null hypothesis.** This is a clearly defined model about chances. It says that the data were generated at random under clearly specified assumptions about the randomness. The word \"null\" reinforces the idea that if the data look different from what the null hypothesis predicts, the difference is due to *nothing* but chance.\n",

    "From a practical perspective, **the null hypothesis is a hypothesis under which you can simulate data.**\n",

    "Under this hypothesis, we were able to simulate random samples, by using `sample_proportions(929, [0.75, 0.25])`. We used a sample size of 929 because that's the number of plants Mendel grew.\n",

This indicates that the statistic should be the *distance* between the sample percent and 75, that is, the absolute value of the difference between them. Big values of the distance will make you lean towards the alternative.\n",
    "\n",

    "Just about 5.7% of the simulated random sample averages were 3.667 or below. If we had drawn the students of Section 3 at random from the whole class, the chance that their average would be 13.667 or lower is about 5.7%.\n",

    "The P-value is the chance, based on the model in the null hypothesis, that the test statistic is equal to the value that was observed in the data or is even further in the direction of the alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a P-value is small, that means the tail beyond the observed statistic is small and so the observed statistic is far away from what the null predicts. This implies that the data support the alternative hypothesis better than they support the null.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- If the P-value is less than 5%, it is considered small and the result is called \"statistically significant.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the P-value is even smaller – less than 1% – the result is called \"highly statistically significant.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "By this convention, our P-value of 5.7% is not considered small. So we have to conclude that the GSI's defense holds good – the average score of Section 3 is like those generated by random chance. Formally, the result of the test is not statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you make a conclusion in this way, we recommend that you don't just say whether or not the result is statistically significant. Along with your conclusion, provide the observed statistic and the P-value as well, so that readers can use their own judgment."

    "The determination of statistical significance, as defined above, has become standard in statistical analyses in all fields of application. When a convention is so universally followed, it is interesting to examine how it arose. \n",
    "\n",
    "The method of statistical testing – choosing between hypotheses based on data in random samples – was developed by Sir Ronald Fisher in the early 20th century. Sir Ronald might have set the convention for statistical significance somewhat unwittingly, in the following statement in his 1925 book *Statistical Methods for Research Workers*. About the 5% level, he wrote, \"It is convenient to take this point as a limit in judging whether a deviation is to be considered significant or not.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What was \"convenient\" for Sir Ronald became a cutoff that has acquired the status of a universal constant. No matter that Sir Ronald himself made the point that the value was his personal choice from among many: in an article in 1926, he wrote, \"If one in twenty does not seem high enough odds, we may, if we prefer it draw the line at one in fifty (the 2 percent point), or one in a hundred (the 1 percent point). Personally, the author prefers to set a low standard of significance at the 5 percent point ...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher knew that \"low\" is a matter of judgment and has no unique definition. We suggest that you follow his excellent example. Provide your data, make your judgment, and explain why you made it."
