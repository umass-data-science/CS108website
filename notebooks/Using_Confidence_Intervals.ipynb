    "### Using Confidence Intervals ###\n",
    "A confidence interval has a single purpose – to estimate an unknown parameter based on data in a random sample. In the last section, we said that the interval (36%, 42%) was an approximate 95% confidence interval for the percent of smokers among mothers in the population. That was a formal way of saying that by our estimate, the percent of smokers among the mothers in the population was somewhere between 36% and 42%, and that our process of estimation is correct about 95% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to resist the impulse to use confidence intervals for other purposes. For example, recall that we calculated the interval (26.9 years, 27.6 years) as an approximate 95% confidence interval for the average age of mothers in the population. A dismayingly common misuse of the interval is to conclude that about 95% of the women were between 26.9 years and 27.6 years old. You don't need to know much about confidence intervals to see that this can't be right – you wouldn't expect 95% of mothers to all be within a few months of each other in age. Indeed, the histogram of the sampled ages shows quite a bit of variation."

    "\n",
    "This use of confidence intervals is the result of a *duality* between confidence intervals and tests: if you are testing whether or not the population mean is a particular value *x*, and you use the 5% cutoff for the P-value, then you will reject the null hypothesis if *x* is not in your 95% confidence interval for the mean. \n",
