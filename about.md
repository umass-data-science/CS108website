Data 8 is a "Foundations in Data Science" course taught for first year students
at UC Berkeley. It combines principles/skills in statistics, programming,
inference, modeling, hypothesis testing, visualization, and exploration.
In short, it provides a foundation in the many fields encompassed by
"data science", and gives students a practical introduction to the field.
